347. Module Introduction
    - All the requests we worked up to now were sent from a browser, and the response was always a redirect or a html page

    - There are some responses that can only exchange data
        - That's what this module is all about

348. What are Async Requests?
    - Summing up, send some data in request, and receive some data back, without reloading the page

349. Adding Client Side JS Code
    * Now, when we delete an item, we will update our database, and then create a new request to load our page;
        * We will modify it to, when we delete a product, we delete from the backend and delete it from our DOM
    
    * We create a admin.js file in the public folder (that will run in the browser)

    - We started creating a function that will get product info from the DOM elements
